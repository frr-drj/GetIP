# GetIP
The GetIP Python Script is a command-line tool designed for Termux on Android devices. This script allows users to extract the IP address of a given website while providing a visually appealing and interactive experience. It features a large "GetIP" banner, colorful text, and an option to restart or exit the program.


## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed in your Termux environment:

- `pyfiglet` for generating the large text banner.
- `termcolor` for colored text output.

You can install these libraries using `pip` in Termux:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```

```bash
pip install termcolor
```

```bash
pkg install git
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thedrjbot/GetIP
```

## Run

cd getIP.py
```

```bash
python getIP.py
```
